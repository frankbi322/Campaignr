This project was built using the following technologies:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB, using mLab
* React/Redux frontend

Additional technologies used:
* Google oAuth - allows users to sign in with their existing Google accounts instead of creating new accounts and passwords.
* Stripe API - allows users to buy credits to create surveys to send to people. NOTE: I used a free development account for this project, so please do not enter actual credit card info! Stripe provides a dummy credit card to use:
  * Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 \n
  * Expiration date: any month/year in the future \n
  * Card Security value: any 3 digit number \n

* SendGrid: email sending platform.  
* Materialize: boostrap CSS
